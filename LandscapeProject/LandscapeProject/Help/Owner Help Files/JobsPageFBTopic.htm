 <h1> First Box With Material And Job Pages </h1>

This page will go in-depth to the functionality of everything 
on each page in the First Box.

<p> <b> - Functionality - </b> </p>
<p> <b> Job Materials </b> </p>
<p> On the first page, Job Materials, there will be another Data Grid Viewer
that will show information for all the materials that are associated with the job
that was selected. Below the Viewer, there is a ComboBox that you can use 
to type or select a category (which is a column from the Viewer), and proceed 
to the TextBox below it to enter new information. When new information has been 
entered, click the "Submit Changes" button to update the database with the new 
information. If you click "Cancel Changes", it will clear your selection and entered
information. If you click "Delete Selected Material", you will remove that material from 
its associated job. </p>

<p> <b> Add Material </b> </p>
<p> On the second page, Add Material, there will be four TextBoxes that will allow
you to enter the necessary information needed to add a new material to the job 
you have selected. Once you have your information entered, there will be two buttons 
below the TextBoxes. If you click "Add Material", it will add your information to the database
and associate that material to the job. If you click "Cancel Adding Material", it will clear
all the information that you had entered. </p>

<p> <b> Add Job </b> </p>
<p> On the third page, Add Job, there will be six TextBoxes that will allow
you to enter the necessary information needed to add a new job. Once you have your
 information entered, there will be two buttons below the TextBoxes. Note that you do not 
have to enter information for End Date or Price right away, you can add it later. If you 
click "Add Job", it will add your information to the database. If you click "Cancel Adding 
Job", it will clear all the information that you had entered. </p>

<p> <b> Edit Job Info </b> </p>
<p> On the fourth page, Edit Job Info, there will be a ComboBox that you can use 
to type or select a category (which is a column from the Viewer), and proceed 
to the TextBox below it to enter new information. When new information has been 
entered, click the "Submit Changes" button to update the database with the new 
information. If you click "Cancel Changes", it will clear your selection and entered
information. If you click "Delete Selected Job", you will remove that Job as well as 
any materials associated with it and remove any workers that was working on that job. </p>
