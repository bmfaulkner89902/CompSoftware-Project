<p> In the First Box, Add A New Contractor, there will be seven TextBoxes that will allow

Once you have your information entered, there will be two buttons below the TextBoxes. 
If you click "Add Contractor", it will add your information to the database and create that contractor.
 If you click "Cancel Adding Contractor", it will clear all the information that you had entered. </p>
