 <h1> Employee Time Tables </h1>

This page will go in-depth to the functionality of the Employee Time Tables Button on
the reports page.

<p> <b> - Functionality - </b> </p>
<p> <b> Employee Time Tables </b> </p>
<p> When this button is clicked, it will load up a report that will show specific information.
The information in order will be WorkerID, FullName, Clock_In, Clock_In_Break, Clock_Out_Break and Clock_Out.
There will also be a column to the left of the main information that will hold each WorkerID in groups so that all
Time Table information associated with that worker will be listed together instead of being random throughout the report. </p>
