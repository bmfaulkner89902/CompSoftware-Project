 <h1> Data Grid Viewer </h1>

This page will go in-depth to the functionality of the Viewer on the Jobs Page.

<p> <b>-  Functionality - </b> </p>
<p> The Viewer on this page will display everything that is on file for jobs
from a database. The Viewer will contain 7 columns that each hold different data.
These columns in order are: JobID, JobType, Address, BeginDate, EndDate, Price 
and JobSize_In_Yards. Every column can be edited in the Edit Job Info page of the 
First Box, except for the JobID column, which can never be changed.  </p>
