 <h1> Reports Viewer </h1>

This page will go in-depth to the functionality of the Viewer on the Reports Page.

<p> <b>-  Functionality - </b> </p>
<p> The Viewer on this page will hold and display the selected report. In the top left corner
there will be an Export Button which can be used when you want to save the report. </p>

<p> The next button is the Print Button which can be used when you want to print the report onto paper through
a printer. </p>
 
<p> The next button is the Refresh Button which can be used to update the report incase there
were any changes made to the database. </p>

<p> The next button is the Copy Button which can be used when you want to 
copy the report and paste it somewhere on your machine. </p>

<p> The next button is the Toggle Parameter Panel Button which will open
 a side panel but won't do anything else for these reports. </p>

<p> The next button is the Toggle Group Tree Button which will display 
all the numbers from the Asterick(*) column in the reports. These numbers 
can then be selected and it will highlight that number in the report. If you click 
on the gorup number in the report it will open a seperate report that will show the 
information associated with that group number. To close that report, click the small
 X next to the "SAP CRYSTAL REPORTS" in the top right corner.  </p>

<p> The next four buttons are for going back and forth through the pages of the report.
The first and last arrows are for going to the first page, (first arrow),  and last page, (last arrow),
of the report. The two middle arrows are for going to the previous and next pages respectively. </p>

<p> The final two buttons are for finding a word on the page and then for changing the zoom scale percentage of the report </p>
