 <h1> Job Financials </h1>

This page will go in-depth to the functionality of the Job Financials Button on
the reports page.

<p> <b> - Functionality - </b> </p>
<p> <b> Job Financials </b> </p>
<p> When this button is clicked, it will load up a report that will show specific information.
The information in order will be JobID, Address, Price (Job Price), MaterialID, MaterialType and Price(Material Price). 
There will also be a column to the left of the main information that will hold each JobID in groups so that all
materials associated with the job will be listed together instead of being random throughout the report. </p>
